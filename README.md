# The Newsletter

## What?

This is a reworked & extended version of [The Newsletter](https://github.com/d-mv/newsletter).

## Why?

Instead of SSR technology it is feasible for this kind of project to use SPA + server. This can later be transformed to PWA (more likely) or native app.

## Stack

For SPA I have chosen React + Redux, SCSS, Web Font Loader. For server - Node, Express, MongoDB via Mongoose, Fast XML Parser.
